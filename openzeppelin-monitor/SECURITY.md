# Security Policy

Security vulnerabilities should be [disclosed](#reporting-a-vulnerability) to the [project maintainers](./CODEOWNERS), or alternatively by email to security@openzeppelin.com.

## Supported Versions

The following versions are currently supported and receive security updates. Alpha, Beta and Release candidates will not receive security updates.

Security patches will be released for the latest minor of a given major release. For example, if an issue is found in versions >=1.13.0 and the latest is 1.14.0, the patch will be released only in version 1.14.1.

Only critical severity bug fixes will be backported to past major releases.

| --------- | ------------------ |
| >= 0.1.x  | :white_check_mark: |
