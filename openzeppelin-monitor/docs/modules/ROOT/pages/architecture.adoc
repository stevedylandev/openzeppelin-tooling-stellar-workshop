:description: Detailed information about the OpenZeppelin Monitor system architecture and component interactions.

This document describes the high-level architecture of OpenZeppelin Monitor, including the core components, their interactions, and the overall system design. It provides a technical overview of how the service processes blockchain data and triggers notifications based on configurable conditions.

== System Overview

OpenZeppelin Monitor is organized as a data processing pipeline that spans from blockchain data collection to notification delivery. The system follows a modular architecture with distinct components for each step in the monitoring process, designed for scalability and extensibility.

=== Data Flow Architecture

==== 1. Block Discovery Phase
The `BlockWatcherService` initiates the monitoring cycle by:

* Retrieving the last processed block number from `BlockStorage`
* Querying the blockchain for the latest block number
* Calculating the range of new blocks to process

==== 2. Data Retrieval Phase
The `BlockchainClient` fetches block data:

* Connects to the appropriate blockchain network via RPC
* Retrieves full block data including transactions and events
* Handles network-specific data formats and protocols

==== 3. Filtering Phase
The `FilterService` processes each block:

* Applies monitor-specific filters to transactions and events
* Evaluates match expressions and conditions
* Identifies relevant data that matches monitoring criteria

==== 4. Trigger Evaluation Phase
The `TriggerExecutionService` processes matches:

* Evaluates trigger conditions for matched data
* Prepares notification payloads with relevant context
* Determines which notification channels to activate

==== 5. Notification Delivery Phase
The `NotificationService` delivers alerts:

* Formats messages for each notification channel
* Handles channel-specific delivery protocols
* Manages delivery retries and error handling

==== 6. State Persistence Phase
The `BlockStorage` updates processing state:

* Records the latest processed block number
* Ensures data consistency for recovery scenarios
* Maintains processing history for debugging

=== Error Handling and Resilience

The architecture includes several resilience mechanisms:

* **Connection Pooling**: The `ClientPool` manages multiple connections to prevent single points of failure
* **State Recovery**: `BlockStorage` enables the service to resume from the last known good state after restarts
* **Retry Logic**: Notification delivery includes configurable retry mechanisms for transient failures
* **Graceful Degradation**: Individual component failures don't cascade to the entire system

For detailed information about RPC logic and network communication, see the xref:rpc.adoc[RPC section].

== Configuration Architecture

The system uses a JSON-based configuration system organized into distinct categories:

=== Configuration Categories

* **Network Configurations**: Define blockchain network connections, RPC endpoints, and network parameters
* **Monitor Configurations**: Specify monitoring rules, conditions, and network/trigger references
* **Trigger Configurations**: Define notification settings and script definitions
* **Filter Configurations**: Contain match filter scripts for data filtering

=== Configuration Validation

The system implements comprehensive validation:

* Cross-reference validation between monitors, networks, and triggers
* Schema validation for all configuration files
* Runtime validation of configuration references during service startup

== Extensibility Points

The architecture is designed for extensibility in several key areas:

=== Blockchain Support
* **Client Layer**: New blockchain protocols can be added by implementing the `BlockchainClient` trait
* **Transport Layer**: Protocol-specific transport clients handle network communication details
* **Filter Layer**: Chain-specific filters process protocol-dependent data formats

=== Notification Channels
* **Channel Plugins**: New notification channels can be added by implementing the notification interface
* **Script Support**: Custom notification logic can be implemented using Python, JavaScript, or Bash scripts

=== Monitoring Logic
* **Expression Engine**: Flexible expression evaluation for complex monitoring conditions
* **Script Triggers**: Custom trigger logic can be implemented using supported scripting languages

== Performance Considerations

The architecture is optimized for:

* **Concurrent Processing**: Multiple networks can be monitored simultaneously
* **Efficient Block Processing**: Batch processing of blocks to minimize RPC calls
* **Memory Management**: Streaming processing of large blocks to prevent memory issues
* **Connection Reuse**: Client pooling reduces connection overhead

== Security Architecture

The system implements several security measures:

* **Secure Protocols**: Support for HTTPS/WSS
* **Secret Management**: Secure handling of API keys and sensitive configuration data
* **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all external inputs and configurations
