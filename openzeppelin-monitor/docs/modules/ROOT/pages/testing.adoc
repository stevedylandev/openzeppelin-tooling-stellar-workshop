:description: Comprehensive guide for testing OpenZeppelin Monitor

This document provides information about testing OpenZeppelin Monitor, including running tests, generating coverage reports, and understanding the test structure.

== Test Organization

The project includes comprehensive test suites organized into different categories:

=== Test Types

* **Unit Tests**: Located within `src/` modules alongside the code they test
* **Integration Tests**: Located in `tests/integration/` directory
* **Property-based Tests**: Located in `tests/properties/` directory
* **Mock Implementations**: Located in `tests/integration/mocks/`

=== Test Structure

```

│   ├── blockwatcher/   # Block monitoring tests
│   ├── filters/        # Filter logic tests
│   ├── fixtures/       # Test data and configurations
│   ├── mocks/          # Mock implementations
│   └── ...
├── properties/         # Property-based tests
│   ├── filters/        # Filter property tests

│   └── ...
└── integration.rs      # Integration test entry point
```

== Running Tests

=== All Tests

Run the complete test suite:

[source,bash]
----
RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 cargo test
----

[NOTE]
====
`RUST_TEST_THREADS=1` is required to prevent test conflicts when accessing shared resources like configuration files or network connections.
====

=== Specific Test Categories

**Property-based Tests:**
[source,bash]
----
RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 cargo test properties
----

**Integration Tests:**
[source,bash]
----
RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 cargo test integration
----

**Unit Tests Only:**
[source,bash]
----
RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 cargo test --lib
----

== Coverage Reports

=== Prerequisites

Install the coverage tool:
[source,bash]
----
rustup component add llvm-tools-preview
cargo install cargo-llvm-cov
----

=== Generating Coverage

**HTML Coverage Report:**
[source,bash]
----
RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 cargo +stable llvm-cov --html --open
----

This generates an HTML report in `target/llvm-cov/html/` and opens it in your browser.

**Terminal Coverage Report:**
[source,bash]
----
RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 cargo +stable llvm-cov
----

== Troubleshooting

=== Common Issues

**Tests hanging or timing out:**
- Ensure `RUST_TEST_THREADS=1` is set
- Verify mock setups are correct

**Coverage tool not found:**
- Install with `cargo install cargo-llvm-cov`
- Add component with `rustup component add llvm-tools-preview`

**Permission errors:**
- Ensure test directories are writable
- Check file permissions on test fixtures

=== Debug Output

Enable debug logging for tests:
[source,bash]
----
RUST_LOG=debug RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 cargo test -- --nocapture
----

== Contributing Tests

When contributing new features:

1. **Add comprehensive tests** for new functionality
2. **Ensure all tests pass** locally before submitting
3. **Include both unit and integration tests** where appropriate
4. **Update test documentation** if adding new test patterns
5. **Maintain or improve code coverage**
