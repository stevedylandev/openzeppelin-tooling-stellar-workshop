:description: Detailed information about the OpenZeppelin Monitor project organization and file structure.

This document describes the project structure and organization of the OpenZeppelin Monitor codebase, including the source code layout, configuration files, and development resources.

== Project Layout

The project follows a standard Rust project layout with additional directories for configuration, documentation, and operational resources:

```
openzeppelin-monitor/
├── src/                # Source code
│   ├── bootstrap/      # Bootstrap functions for the application
│   ├── models/         # Data structures and types
│   ├── repositories/   # Configuration storage
│   ├── services/       # Core business logic
│   ├── utils/          # Helper functions
│
├── config/             # Configuration files
├── tests/              # Integration and property-based tests
├── data/               # Runtime data storage
├── docs/               # Documentation
├── scripts/            # Utility scripts
├── cmd/                # Metrics and monitoring
├── examples/           # Example configuration files
└── ... other root files (Cargo.toml, README.md, etc.)
```

== Source Code Organization

=== `src/` Directory

The main source code directory contains the core implementation files organized into several modules:

==== `bootstrap/`
Application initialization and setup for `main.rs`:

* Handles service initialization and dependency injection
* Manages the startup sequence and service lifecycle

==== `models/`
Core data structures and types:

* `blockchain/`: Platform-specific implementations
** `evm/`: Ethereum Virtual Machine specific types
** `stellar/`: Stellar blockchain specific types
* `config/`: Configuration loading and validation
* `core/`: Core domain models
* `security/`: Security and secret management

==== `repositories/`
Configuration storage:

* Handles loading and validating configuration files
* Provides storage interfaces for monitors, networks, and triggers
* Implements validation of configuration references

==== `services/`
Core business logic:

* `blockchain/`: Blockchain client interfaces
** `transports/`: Transport clients
*** `evm/`: Ethereum Virtual Machine transport client
*** `stellar/`: Stellar transport client
** `clients/`: Client implementations
*** `evm/`: Ethereum Virtual Machine client
*** `stellar/`: Stellar client
* `blockwatcher/`: Block monitoring and processing
* `filter/`: Transaction and event filtering
** `filters/`: Filter implementations
*** `evm/`: Ethereum Virtual Machine filter
*** `stellar/`: Stellar filter
* `notification/`: Alert handling
* `trigger/`: Trigger evaluation and execution
** `script/`: Script execution utilities

==== `utils/`
Helper functions:

* `cron_utils`: Cron schedule utilities
* `expression`: Expression evaluation
* `logging/`: Logging utilities
* `macros/`: Macros for common functionality
* `metrics/`: Metrics utilities
* `monitor/`: Monitor configuration test utilities
* `tests/`: Contains test utilities and helper functions
** `builders/`: Test builder patterns implementing fluent interfaces for creating test fixtures
*** `evm/`: Builder implementations specific to Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) testing
*** `stellar/`: Builder implementations specific to Stellar blockchain testing

== Configuration and Data

=== `config/` Directory

Contains JSON configuration files for:

* **Network configurations** (`networks/`)
** Connection details for blockchain networks
** RPC endpoints and network parameters

* **Monitor configurations** (`monitors/`)
** Monitoring rules and conditions
** Network and trigger references

* **Trigger configurations** (`triggers/`)
** Notification settings
** Script definitions

* **Filter configurations** (`filters/`)
** Match filter scripts

[TIP]
====
The `examples/config/` directory contains example JSON configuration files for each (network, monitor, trigger and filters).
====

=== `data/` Directory

Runtime data storage:

* Block processing state
* Operational data
* Temporary files

[NOTE]
====
The `data/`, `logs/` and `config/` directories are gitignored except for example files. These directories are mounted to persist the configs and runtime data.
====

== Examples and Resources

=== `examples/` Directory

Provides practical examples and sample configurations to help users get started:

* Demonstrates typical service configurations for various networks
* Acts as a quick-start guide for customizing the monitor
* Serves as a reference for best practices in configuration

== Metrics and Monitoring

=== `cmd/prometheus/` Directory

Prometheus exporters and monitoring infrastructure:

* `dashboards/`: Grafana dashboards
* `datasources/`: Prometheus datasources
* `prometheus.yml`: Prometheus configuration
* `grafana.ini`: Grafana configuration

== Testing and Documentation

=== `tests/` Directory

Contains comprehensive test suites:

* Integration tests
* Property-based tests
* Mock implementations
* Test utilities and helpers

=== `docs/` Directory

Project documentation:

* User guides
* API documentation
* Configuration examples
* Architecture diagrams

=== `scripts/` Directory

Utility scripts for:

* Development workflows
* Documentation generation
* Build processes
* Deployment helpers

== Development Tools

=== Pre-commit Hooks

Located in the project root:

* Code formatting checks
* Linting rules
* Commit message validation

=== Build Configuration

Core build files:

* `Cargo.toml`: Project dependencies and metadata
* `rustfmt.toml`: Code formatting rules
* `rust-toolchain.toml`: Rust version and components

== Docker Support

The project includes Docker configurations for different environments:

* `Dockerfile.development`: Development container setup
* `Dockerfile.production`: Production-ready container
* Before running the docker compose set your env variables in `.env` according to your needs

[TIP]
====
For detailed information about running the monitor in containers, see the Docker deployment xref:index.adoc#docker_installation[section] in the user documentation.
