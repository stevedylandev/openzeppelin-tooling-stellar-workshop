:description: Guidelines for contributing to OpenZeppelin Monitor

Welcome to the OpenZeppelin Monitor project! We appreciate your interest in contributing. This guide outlines the requirements and processes for contributing to the project.

== Getting Started

The OpenZeppelin Monitor project has comprehensive contribution guidelines documented in the link:https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-monitor/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md[`CONTRIBUTING.md`] file. This documentation provides a summary of key requirements, but for complete details including GitHub workflow, labeling guidelines, and advanced topics, please refer to the full CONTRIBUTING.md file.

[TIP]
====
For the most up-to-date and comprehensive contribution guidelines, always refer to the link:https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-monitor/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md[CONTRIBUTING.md] file in the repository.
====

== Key Requirements

=== Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

**You must sign the CLA before contributing.** The CLA process is automated through GitHub workflows that check and label PRs accordingly.

* All contributors must complete the CLA process
* The CLA bot will automatically check your PR status
* PRs cannot be merged without a signed CLA

=== Signed Commits

**All commits must be GPG-signed** as a security requirement.

* Configure GPG signing for your commits
* Unsigned commits will not be accepted
* This helps ensure code integrity and authenticity

== Development Environment Setup

=== Prerequisites

Before contributing, ensure you have:

* **Rust 2021 edition** - Required for development
* **Git** - For version control
* **Python/pip** - For pre-commit hooks

=== System Dependencies (Linux)

For Ubuntu 22.04+ or Debian-based systems (both x86 and ARM64 architectures), install required packages:

**Note:** Python 3.9+ is required for pre-commit hooks compatibility.

[source,bash]
----
# Install required packages directly
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y \
    build-essential \
    curl \
    git \
    pkg-config \
    libssl-dev \
    libffi-dev \
    libyaml-dev \
    python3 \
    python3-venv \
    python3-pip
----

Or use the provided system package script (automatically ensures Python 3.9+ compatibility):

[source,bash]
----
chmod +x ./scripts/linux/sys_pkgs_core.sh
chmod +x ./scripts/linux/sys_pkgs_dev.sh
# Installs required packages and ensures compatible Python version
./scripts/linux/sys_pkgs_core.sh   // For runtime dependencies only
./scripts/linux/sys_pkgs_dev.sh    // For Python/dev dependencies (calls core script)
----

=== Initial Setup

[source,bash]
----
# Clone and set up the repository
git clone https://github.com/openzeppelin/openzeppelin-monitor
cd openzeppelin-monitor

# Build the project
cargo build

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
----

=== Running Tests

[source,bash]
----
# All tests
RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 cargo test

# Integration tests
RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 cargo test integration

# Property-based tests
RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 cargo test properties
----

== Development Workflow

=== 1. Pre-commit Hooks

**Required for code quality checks** including `rustfmt`, `clippy`, and commit message validation.

* Install and configure pre-commit hooks
* Automatic formatting and linting checks
* Commit message format validation

==== Installing Pre-commit Hooks

Install and configure pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality:

[source,bash]
----
# Install pre-commit (use pipx for global installation if preferred)
pip install pre-commit

# Install and configure hooks for commit-msg, pre-commit, and pre-push
pre-commit install --install-hooks -t commit-msg -t pre-commit -t pre-push
----

[TIP]
====
If you encounter issues with pip install, you may need to install link:https://github.com/pypa/pipx[pipx] for global installation. Use `pipx install pre-commit` instead.
====

The pre-commit hooks will automatically run on every commit and push, checking for:
* Code formatting with `rustfmt`
* Linting with `clippy`
* Commit message format validation
* Other code quality checks

=== 2. GitHub Workflow

==== Fork and Clone

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:

[source,bash]
----
# Set up your working directory
export working_dir="${HOME}/repos"
export user=<your-github-username>

# Clone your fork
mkdir -p $working_dir
cd $working_dir
git clone https://github.com/$user/openzeppelin-monitor.git

# Add upstream remote
cd openzeppelin-monitor
git remote add upstream https://github.com/openzeppelin/openzeppelin-monitor.git
git remote set-url --push upstream no_push
----

==== Branch Management

* Create feature branches from an up-to-date main branch
* Regularly sync with upstream
* Use descriptive branch names

[source,bash]
----
# Keep main updated
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git rebase upstream/main

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Keep branch updated
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
----

[TIP]
====
Use `git rebase` instead of `git pull` to avoid merge commits and maintain a clean history.
====

=== 3. Pull Request Process

==== Creating a Pull Request

1. **Push your changes** to your fork:
+
[source,bash]
----
git push -f origin feature/your-feature-name
----

2. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub
3. **Add appropriate labels** (see Labeling Guidelines below)
4. **Include a clear description** of your changes

==== Best Practices for PRs

* Write clear and meaningful commit messages
* Include `fixes #123` in PR body (not commit messages) to auto-close issues
* Break large changes into smaller, logical commits
* Ensure all tests pass
* Include sufficient information for reviewers

== Code Standards

=== Rust Standards

Rust API Guidelines:

* Format code with `rustfmt`
* Pass all `clippy` linting checks
* Follow Rust naming conventions

[source,bash]
----
# Format code
cargo fmt

# Check linting
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features

# Run tests
RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 cargo test
----

=== Testing Requirements

**All contributions must pass existing tests** and include new tests when applicable:

* Write unit tests for new functionality
* Add integration tests for complex features
* Ensure all tests pass before submitting
* Maintain or improve code coverage

For detailed testing information, see the xref:testing.adoc[Testing Guide].

=== Commit Message Format

**Follow conventional commit format** with types like:

* `feat:` - New features
* `fix:` - Bug fixes
* `docs:` - Documentation changes
* `test:` - Test additions or modifications
* `refactor:` - Code refactoring
* `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

== Issue and Pull Request Labeling

The project uses a structured labeling system to organize issues and PRs. Key label categories include:

=== Area Labels (`A-`)
* `A-arch` - Architectural concerns
* `A-blocks` - Block processing
* `A-clients` - Blockchain clients
* `A-configs` - Configuration issues
* `A-docs` - Documentation
* `A-tests` - Testing

=== Type Labels (`T-`)
* `T-bug` - Bug reports
* `T-feature` - New features
* `T-task` - General tasks
* `T-documentation` - Documentation updates

=== Priority Labels (`P-`)
* `P-high` - Critical tasks
* `P-medium` - Important tasks
* `P-low` - Low priority

=== Difficulty Labels (`D-`)
* `D-easy` - Beginner-friendly
* `D-medium` - Intermediate
* `D-hard` - Complex issues

== Code Review Process

=== Review Requirements

* All PRs require review and approval
* At least one Reviewer and one Approver must approve
* Address all review comments before merging
* Commits are automatically squashed when merging

=== Review Guidelines

Reviewers should focus on:

1. **Soundness** - Is the idea behind the contribution sound?
2. **Architecture** - Is the contribution architected correctly?
3. **Polish** - Is the contribution polished and ready?
